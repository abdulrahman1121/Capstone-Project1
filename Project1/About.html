    <p> 
        I'm currently taking a web development course at Udemy, and I'm loving it. 
        I'm not just about theory â€“ I'm ready to apply what I've learned to hands-on projects. 
        A quick learner and a team player, I'm eager to contribute my technical skills to exciting, 
        real-world challenges</p>
